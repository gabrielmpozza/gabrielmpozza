## Hello, there ðŸ‘Š

My name is Gabriel, and Iâ€™m from EstÃ¢ncia Velha, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Iâ€™m transitioning from a background in network maintenance and management to focusing on software development. I created this GitHub account to share projects Iâ€™ve been working on, both to learn and practice new technologies and to track my progress. Currently, I work at Delta Sistemas as a Development Assistant.
